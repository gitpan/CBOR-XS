Revision history for Perl extension CBOR::XS

TODO: pack_keys?
TODO: document encode_cbor_sharing?
TODO: weaken cyclic structures?

1.25 Sun Jan  5 15:19:14 CET 2014
	- map key decoding was pretty much botched due to the recent cleanups.
	- work around Time::Piece->epoch returning a string value, avoid encoding
          this as a tag 1 string.
        - enable more testcases in t/50_rfc.t, now that they work :)

1.2  Tue Dec 10 22:06:42 CET 2013
	- implement an incremental decoder.

1.12 Tue Dec  3 11:23:22 CET 2013
	- work around broken Time::Piece (in old versions of the module, %z doesn't
          work as documented, gives different results on different platforms(!)).

1.11 Sun Dec  1 18:00:00 CET 2013
	- new setting: validate_utf8, for when you can't trust your cbor data.
        - do not leak memory on decoding errors, when allow_cycles is enabled.
        - add default filters for tags 0 and 1, using Time::Piece.
        - more tests added.

1.1  Sat Nov 30 19:14:27 CET 2013
	- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: new decoder setting: allow_cyclic, needed to decode
          cyclic data structures (to avoid memleaks in unsuspecting code).
	- no longer "share" references that aren't, i.e. true/false/null/error/tagged.
	- fix stringref w.r.t. indefinite-length strings.
        - verify indefinite-length string chunk types.
        - do not allow extremely large arrays - assume an array element
          requires at least one CBOR byte, to avoid memory exhaustion attacks.
        - major code overhaul.

1.0  Thu Nov 28 16:43:31 CET 2013
        - use the now official tag values for extensions. remove the
          experimental notice. it's the real thing now, with real bugs.
        - renamed allow_stringref to pack_strings.
	- port to perl <= 5.16.
        - slightly improve the documentation.

0.09  Fri Nov 22 16:54:18 CET 2013
	- bignum/bigfloat/decimal support.
        - uri support.
        - tag filter functions support for decoding.
	- do not support reference-to-1/0/undef anymore, you need to use
          the Types::Serialiser objects now.
        - experimental sharable extension support (http://cbor.schmorp.de/value-sharing).
        - experimental stringref extension support (http://cbor.schmorp.de/stringref).
	- implement indirection tag (http://cbor.schmorp.de/indirection).

0.08  Wed Oct 30 11:10:43 CET 2013
	- defused another too fragile test.

0.07  Tue Oct 29 23:04:07 CET 2013
	- don't crash in decode when silly values are passed in.
        - considerably speed up map decoding when map keys
          are utf-8 or byte strings.
        - raising an exception in THAW should now work without
          leaking.

0.06  Tue Oct 29 16:56:07 CET 2013
	- do not leak when deserialiasing via THAW.
        - implement and document CBOR::XS creation/access/mutate
          methods.

0.05  Mon Oct 28 22:27:47 CET 2013
	- do not leak hash keys on decoding.

0.04  Sun Oct 27 23:47:47 CET 2013
	- implement TO_CBOR/FREEZE/THAW serialisation protocols.
        - requested perl-object and generic-object tags from iana.
        - switched to Types::Serialiser for true, false and error.
        - disabled some fragile tests (thanks, andk).

0.03  Sun Oct 27 00:28:41 CEST 2013
	- improve 32 bit platform compatibility.
        - take more advantage of ecb.h.
        - preliminary and bare-bones tagged support.
        - improved docs.

0.02  Sat Oct 26 13:08:05 CEST 2013
	- no aborts left.
	- add $CBOR::XS::MAGIC.
	- preliminary tagged decoding to arrayref.
	- indefinite encoding fixed.
        - half float decoding implemented.
	- t/50_rfc.t adds test vectors from the rfc, which
          are checked as applicable.
